About this project:

I began this project in September with a friend and two classmates whom I did not know yet. Although my teammates are amazing co-workers, this project was difficult to work with from the beginning.  It is the first time all of us have been using GitHub for sharing a file. Managing the Git repository took a lot of communication. Whenever one of us pushed a new save, we made sure everyone was aware. This proved to be helpful because if a piece of code broke, we worked together to troubleshoot and fix it. This is especially relevant because we only met in person once a week, and sharing important information via group chat is difficult.  Information often gets lost the more messages we send.  The first thing that we implemented was a Discord server with different channels: meeting notes, photo uploads, and important events that we pin to reference later. I believe this really helped our team reach tight deadlines, and now that I know the feeling of having good communication between team members. I want to bring this to the other projects I am a part of.
