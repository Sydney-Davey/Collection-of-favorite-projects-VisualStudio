About this project:

I started making the game 3/2/26 in September with one friend that I had known from the start of the semester and two other classmates that I had never talked to. Although my teammates turned out to be amazing co-workers, this project had been difficult to work with from the beginning, as it was the first time all of us had used git for sharing a file. Managing the Git repository took a lot of communication. Whenever one of us pushed a new save, we made sure everyone was aware, and if a piece of code broke, we could quickly work together to troubleshoot and fix it. Especially relevant since we only met in person once a week, and sharing important information via text chat could be difficult, as information often gets lost the more messages we send. So the first thing that we implemented was a Discord server with different channels to organize the information, like meeting notes, photo uploads, and important events or times we can pin to reference later. I believe this really helped our team reach tight deadlines, and now that I know the feeling of having good communication between team members, I want to bring this to the other projects I get to be a part of in the coming years.
